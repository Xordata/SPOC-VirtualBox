Shuttle Portable Computer Flight Procedures Handbook

This is an edited version of the official Shuttle Portable Computer (SPoC)
Flight Procedures Handbook.  This document applies only to the version of
SPoC available through NASA Spacelink.

Orbital state vectors required for this program are available for each
Shuttle mission from NASA Spacelink (Data line 205/895-0028).  Use the
"M50 Elements" figures.  And remember that SPoC requires figures
in thousands of feet.  The M50 elements on NASA Spacelink are often
given in feet.  Don't forget to move the decimal three places to the
left before entering the figures into SPoC.

The following hardware is required for proper operation of this program:

     IBM PC or compatible with math co-processor installed
     Hard Drive at location C:
     Minimum 512K available memory  NOTE:  If you are running software
       (network software for example) that occupies enough memory to
       leave less than 512K for SPoC, SPoC will very likely crash.

GRID.EXE, SPOC.BAT, and the PROGRAMS subdirectory, must be located in the
Drive C: ROOT directory.

To run the SPoC software type SPoC at the C> prompt.

NOTE: The CODE key referred to in this document is the ALT key on IBM PC
      compatible computers.

NOTE: As you will read in the following document, SPoC was written to
      run on  a GRID computer--not an IBM-PC.  Before making SPoC available    
      through NASA Spacelink, we tested it on a variety of IBM-PC and
      compatible computer configurations with mixed results.  For example,
      SPoC seemed to run properly on one computer, but its VGA display
      scrambled the screen making the program unreadable.  Other VGA
      displays gave no problems.  So if SPoC doesn't run on your
      particular setup, try it on another computer.

SECTION 1.0  INTRODUCTION

The concept of an independent computational capability aboard the Shuttle
has been operational since STS-1.  Originally the HP41 hand-held
calculator was employed for this purpose, but it has significant
limitations.  The SPoC greatly augments HP41 capabilities.  STS-9 was the
first Shuttle mission manifested with a SPoC, and it proved to be such an
asset for the crew that a SPoC has been manifested on every subsequent
Shuttle mission.  In its original role it was used as a situational
awareness aid, depicting the Orbiter and its ground track over the earth's
surface.  The SPoC has evolved to provide a backup alternative means of
obtaining landing opportunities, deorbit targets, and center of gravity
management procedures.  These targets and procedures are only utilized in
the event of a total loss of communications with the ground or a time
critical systems failure during a loss of communication period requiring
an emergency deorbit before ground assistance can be provided.  Nominally,
the SPoC is unstowed and set up during the post insertion time frame and
remains active until entry interface minus 20 minutes.

The SPoC saves Mission Control Center (MCC) personnel time and resources
by eliminating need to routinely transmit such data as Aquisition of
Signal/Loss of Signal (AOS/LOS) times via voice or teleprinter.  During
the mission, the Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO) will take SPoC system
questions in the MCC Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) and pass them
to the SPoC Team if necessary.


1.1 SPoC Mission Definition

The SPoC is a portable "lap top" microcomputer providing the crew and
mission operations personnel with an independent computational and display
facility, enhancing productivity and reliability.  This microcomputer is
mandatory for flight because of the crew support it provides.  The SPoC
was designated as noncritical hardware by Configuration Control Board
Directive 1253 in 1983.  This classification was reaffirmed in 1987 by
On-Orbit Flight Techniques Panel Meeting #82 [ref. NASA memo DA8-88-04
(FT)].  Currently, there are four major roles for the SPoC.

a) Provide automated cues for such events as upcoming ground communication
times, earth observation site availability, sunrise and sunset times,
nodal  crossings, orbiter ground track, and location over the earth's
surface.

b) Provide a backup alternative means of obtaining landing opportunities,
deorbit targets, and center of gravity management procedures in the event
of a total loss of communications with the ground or a time-critical
systems failure during a loss of communication period requiring an
emergency deorbit before ground assistance can be provided.

c) Provide computational and display support for special purpose
applications on a flight-specific basis (e.g. the Orbit Refueling System
{ORS} and the Gravity Gradient Free Drift programs).

d) Provide mission status and contingency deorbit support in the Emergency
Mission Control Center (EMCC).


1.2 How To Use This Handbook

This handbook relates procedures and concepts associated with SPoC
operation.  Acronyms and other terms pertinent to this discussion, but
whose definitions may not be apparent from context, are defined in
APPENDIX F (GLOSSARY).  As a convention, the names of SPoC applications
will be in capitals.  A brief history of the SPoC is presented in Appendix
E.

If you are interested in operating SPoC immediately, proceed to
Appendix A, INITIALIZING THE SPoC, for your first SPoC session.
Appendices A through D are designed to provide an introductory overview
without exercising all SPoC capabilities.  For the location of complete
and detailed information, consult the Table of Contents.



SECTION 2.0  HARDWARE

The SPoC has 384k bytes of nonvolatile bubble memory for use in storing
programs and data.  Four Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM)
slots, located above the keyboard, are user-accessible.  Each SPoC EPROM
has a 64k byte capacity, providing 256k bytes of Read Only Memory (ROM).
The SPoC directly accesses 512k bytes of Random Access Memory (RAM).  The
foldup display is a high resolution electroluminescent flat panel which
measures 7-and-9/16 by 3-and-3/4 inches (512 pixels by 256 scanlines).

There are four types of keys on the SPoC: alphabetic/numeric keys,
modifier keys for issuing commands, arrow keys for positioning the cursor,
and a return key for selection box control.  The memory, display, and
57-character keyboard are in a magnesium case,  which together weighs
approximately 10 pounds.  The unit will fit into one-half of a standard
size briefcase.

SPoC is hosted on a GRiD Compass computer purchased off-the-shelf and
modified for flight.  A standard lithium battery circuit that provides
power for the internal clock is replaced by a silver oxide battery and
equipped with diodes and a fuse to ensure fail-safe operation. The
internal modem is removed.  Flight displays are fitted with
electromagnetic interference filters.  This prevents electromagnetic
interference generated by the electroluminescent display from harming the
General Purpose Computers (GPCs) or other equipment onboard.  When used
onboard the Shuttle, SPoC runs on phase A ac power and uses a power cable
which is compatible with the Orbiter's power outlets.  Finally, the foot
of a flight SPoC is milled to permit fan exhaust flow when folded up for
flight operation.


SECTION 3.0  SPoC USER INTERFACE

SPoC applications have been designed for similarity in appearance and
operation.  Utilization of menus and forms allows the user to select,
input, edit, and execute without unnecessary typing.  Menus permit the
user to select a single item for execution, while forms permit the user to
input several data values on one display.  Prompts appear at the bottom of
the screen, as an aid to the user.  When appropriate, error messages also
appear at the bottom of the screen instructing the user how to correct
erroneous inputs.

NOTE: Messages are displayed on the screen in inverse video.  In this
document, messages displayed on screen images will appear as black
characters against a white background.  This is done for readability.


"3.1 Modifier and Command Keys"

Modifier keys include the "CODE" keys, "SHIFT" keys, and the "CONTROL"
key.  The "CODE" keys and "SHIFT" keys are located at the lower left and
lower right of the keyboard.  The "CONTROL" key is located at the lower
left corner of the keyboard.  The "RETURN" key, "ESCAPE" key, and any
other keys that invoke a menu option are command keys.  The most often
used modifier keys are the "CODE" keys. To execute any menu option or to
accept the settings in a form, the user must hold down a modifier key(s)
and then press the appropriate command key.

"CAUTION": SPoC EXPECTS THE COMMAND KEY "PRESS" ACTION TO BE BRIEF (NO
MORE THAN 0.2 SECONDS).  Pressing a command key for finite intervals may
issue multiple instructions with unpredictable results.


"3.2 Special Key Combinations"

Throughout the remainder of this handbook, the following convention will
be followed.  "CODE-[key]" will indicate that the "CODE" key is held down
until the "[key]" is pressed.  As an example, "CODE-RETURN" indicates that
the user holds down the "CODE" key until the "RETURN" key is pressed.
"CODE-ESCAPE" indicates that the "CODE" key is held down until the
"ESCAPE" key is pressed.  "CODE-M" indicates that the "CODE" key is held
down until ""M"" is pressed.  "CODE-CTRL-SHIFT-N" indicates that the
"CODE" key and the "CTRL" key are held down until ""N"" is pressed.  A
menu item will be executed or form settings will be accepted only if a
"CODE-[key]" combination is pressed.  The "CODE-RETURN" combination
executes the menu option selected or accepts the form settings selected.
The "CODE-ESCAPE" combination has a special function.  To exit a menu
without executing any of the displayed options or to exit a form without
modifying the form settings, press "CODE-ESCAPE".  If the user presses
"CODE-ESCAPE", program control returns to the previously displayed screen.
If "CODE-ESCAPE" is pressed at the main menu of a program, the program is
exited and control returns to the SPoC Main Menu, which displays the
available applications.  A "CODE-ESC" from the SPoC Main Menu is ignored.


"3.3 The Selection Box"

The selection box is a moving rectangular outline that encloses the
current option or setting.  In a menu, the selection box identifies the
option that will be executed when the user presses "CODE-RETURN".  In a
form, the selection box identifies data currently being modified.
Movement of the selection box is controlled by the "RETURN" key.  Each
time the "RETURN" key is pressed, the selection box advances to the next
option.  If the "RETURN" key is pressed while the selection box is located
on the last option of the menu, the selection box will advance to the
first option on the menu.

If the menu in receives a "CODE-RETURN" with the selection box located on
the first option, the WORLD MAP application will be executed.  Press the
"RETURN" key once, and the selection box advances to the next option.

If the menu receives a "CODE-RETURN" with the selection box located on the
second option, STATE VECTOR UPDATE will be executed.

"3.4 SPoC Menus"

SPoC menus permit the user to select one option to be executed with a
minimum of keystrokes.  To select an option, press the "RETURN" key
repeatedly until the selection box is located on the option to be
executed.  Press "CODE-RETURN" to execute the option.  There is an
alternate method of selecting and executing an option from a menu.  Press
"CODE-[key]", where "[key]" is the designated letter for the option to be
executed.  Using the SPoC Main Menu as an example, DEORBIT can be selected
by pressing the "RETURN" key three times to locate the selection box on
the menu option DEORBIT.  DEORBIT is then executed by pressing
"CODE-RETURN".  Using the alternate method, DEORBIT can be selected and
executed by pressing "CODE-D" regardless of where the selection box is
currently located.


"3.5 SPoC Forms"

SPoC forms permit the user to enter or edit data for one or more items.
Forms are different from menus for these reasons:

a) Forms let users change the settings of several items.  Menus let users
   select only one option.

b) Users may input their own settings to forms.  Many forms do not limit
users
   to predefined choices.

c) When users press "CODE-RETURN", they accept the settings of all form
items,
   not just the outlined setting.

A form consists of the following components.

"Items": labels which identify data to be modified.  Each item has a
setting associated with it.

"Settings": actual values the user has typed, chosen from the choice band,
or received by default.  These settings are either choice or editable
fields, depending on the application.

"Selection box": moving indicator that surrounds the setting currently
being modified.  "RETURN" moves it down and "SHIFT-UPARROW" moves it up.

"Choice band": located at the top of the form, it may be configured in one
of three ways.  If there are choices for the current item, the choices are
displayed there.  If the item is an editable item, the choice band may be
blank or contain pertinent information with the edit prompt.

"Choices": predefined values for a setting, which appear in the choice
band.  The highlighted choice appears within the selection box
automatically.

"Highlighted box": indicates the choice that appears in the selection box,
when choices are available.  Pressing the arrow keys moves the highlighted
box among choices.  Horizontally grouped choices utilize the "LEFTARROW"
and "RIGHTARROW" keys for movement, while vertically grouped choices are
selected with the "UPARROW" and "DOWNARROW" keys.  If the item is an
editable item, the highlighted box, if displayed, will contain pertinent
information and the edit prompt.

A setting is editable if there are no choices listed in the choice band.
In this case, the edit prompt appears in the selection box as a small
flashing triangular field.  A setting is a choice setting if there are
choices listed in the choice band.

To change data for an editable setting, use the "LEFTARROW" and
"RIGHTARROW" keys to locate the flashing edit prompt.  The following
actions are possible on all data left of the prompt.

1) Press the "BACK SPACE" key to erase the rightmost character of data.
2) Press "CODE-BACK SPACE" to erase the rightmost word of data.
3) Press "CODE-SHIFT-BACK SPACE" to erase all data.

Data may be inserted right of the flashing prompt by pressing the
appropriate keys.  Once satisfied with the settings, press "CODE-RETURN"
to incorporate all settings and proceed to the next form or menu.  To exit
a form without accepting any new settings, press "CODE-ESC".  Upon
pressing "CODE-ESC", the former item settings are restored and the
previous form or menu will be displayed.


"3.6 Messages"

There are three types of SPoC messages.

1) Prompts
2) Error messages
3) Informative messages

As an aid to the user, each SPoC menu or form has prompts displayed at the
bottom of the screen.  Information provided by prompts will inform the
user what action should be taken next.

Error messages provide information for correcting erroneous user inputs.

Informative messages provide status on what action is currently being
taken.  Informative messages require no user action.




SECTION 4.0  OVERVIEW OF SPoC PROGRAMS

In this section, a high level overview of SPoC software will be presented.
There are five operating modes for SPoC software: InFlight, Debug,
Development, SmartDemo, and DummyDemo.

This document pertains only to the InFlight mode.


"LAUNCH TIME UPDATE"

During SPoC initialization, the actual launch Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
can be input to update the launch time expected premission.  The launch
time is stored in bubble memory and used to compute Mission Elapsed Time
(MET).


"GMT UPDATE"

Current GMT can be updated in SPoC's internal clock.  The internal clock
is maintained by an internal battery during periods when SPoC power is
OFF.


"STATE VECTOR UPDATE"

This program allows the user to input position and velocity vectors in the
Mean of 50 (M50) coordinate system.  These vectors are obtained from the
GPC Memory Page and are written to bubble memory for access by other
programs.


"SPoC EXECUTIVE"

The SPoC EXECUTIVE program displays the SPoC Main Menu from which the user
may select the application desired.  Upon exiting any program selected
from the SPoC Main Menu, program control returns to the SPoC Main Menu.


"WORLD MAP"

The SPoC presently runs WORLD MAP as its primary program.  A graphics
display of a world map is overlaid by the Orbiter's current trajectory
status.  The following information/functions are available.

        Current MET
        Fixed coastline and Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN)/
        Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) coverage graphics
        Day and night areas on the earth's surface
        AOS/LOS and identification of next/current ground communication site
        AOS/LOS and identification of next/current TDRS coverage
        Current and two predicted ground tracks
        Current position of the Orbiter on the world map

        Sun glint look angles
        Longitude and MET of the next/previous ascending node
        Time until/from the next/previous ascending node

SECTION 5.0  BOOT UP SCREEN

When SPoC is turned ON, the Boot Up Screen is displayed after several
seconds.  At the bottom center of this screen will be displayed the
message:

Boot in Progress
Please Wait

The contents of the rest of the screen will indicate:

    1) Specific or Generic Flight Load
    2) Flight or Training Load
    3) Version Number

After the operating system has been loaded, the Boot Up Screen will be
erased.  The following message will be displayed at the bottom of the
screen while SPoC EXECUTIVE searches for the necessary applications.

"Searching for all the necessary SPoC programs"

Next, SPoC EXECUTIVE will search for necessary data files.  The following
message will be displayed.


"Searching for all the necessary SPoC data files"


Upon completion of the data file search, the LAUNCH TIME UPDATE form will
be displayed.  If this form does not appear, a fatal error has been
detected in the current SPoC software configuration by SPoC EXECUTIVE.




SECTION 6.0  LAUNCH TIME UPDATE

This program allows the user to update the GMT of launch.  Upon completion
of the boot cycle, the LAUNCH TIME UPDATE form (FIGURE 6.1) is displayed.
Initial settings displayed indicate nominal launch time.  These settings
can be updated by the user in the event of a launch delay.

If the launch form settings are correct, press "CODE-RETURN".  Otherwise,
correct any erroneous data.

Acceptable inputs for LAUNCH TIME UPDATE FORM:
   YEAR    - 1983 through 1999
   DAY     - 1 through 365 in common years, 1 through 366 in leap years
   HOUR    - 0 through 23
   MINUTE  - 0 through 59
   SECOND  - 0 through 59

Possible Error Messages:
    1) "ERROR: Time parameter(s) input incorrectly"

   Problem:  One or more of the settings are not within acceptable limits
or are not formatted as integers.

       Solution: The symbol "->" will appear next to out-of-range or
improperly formatted settings.  Replace erroneous data with good data.




SECTION 7.0  GMT UPDATE


After pressing "CODE-RETURN" from the LAUNCH TIME UPDATE form, the GMT
UPDATE form will automatically appear.  This form can also be accessed
from the SPoC Main Menu.  The time displayed in this form is used to set
the internal SPoC clock when "CODE-RETURN" is pressed.  The GMT will have
to be updated to correct internal clock drift.  SPoC clock drift will
average approximately five seconds per day.

Acceptable inputs for GMT UPDATE form:
      DAY    - 1 through 365 in common years, 1 through 366 in leap years
      HOUR   - 1 through 23
      MINUTE - 1 through 59
      YEAR   - 1980 through 1999

Possible Error Messages:
1) "ERROR: Time parameter( s ) input incorrectly"

Problem: The settings for the items listed in the error message are not
within acceptable limits.

Solution: The symbol "->" will appear next to out-of-range settings.
Replace data that are not within acceptable limits.

Possible Caution Messages:
1) "CAUTION: Vector more than 2 days old"

Problem: SPoC GMT and the current SPoC state vector time tag are
incompatible.  The state vector time tag is two days older than
current SPoC GMT.

Solution: If GMT settings are incorrect, press "CODE-ESC" to
              reinitialize the form.  Correct erroneous data.

         If GMT settings are correct, press "CODE-RETURN".  The state
         vector time tag settings can be updated in the STATE VECTOR UPDATE
         form.

2) "CAUTION: Vector is in the future"

Problem: SPoC GMT and the current SPoC state vector time tag are
         incompatible. The time tag for the current SPoC state vector is
         in the future.

Solution: If GMT settings are incorrect, press "CODE-ESC" to
          reinitialize the form.  Correct erroneous data.

        If GMT settings are correct, press "CODE-RETURN".  The state
        vector time tag settings can be updated in the STATE VECTOR UPDATE
        form.



SECTION 8.0  STATE VECTOR UPDATE

The STATE VECTOR UPDATE form allows users to update the SPoC state vector.
This form will automatically appear after pressing "CODE-RETURN" from the
GMT UPDATE form during the SPoC initialization sequence.  STATE VECTOR
UPDATE can also be accessed from the SPoC Main Menu.

Components of the previously input time tag and state vector are initially
displayed in the STATE VECTOR UPDATE form.  Prelaunch, a predicted nominal
post-OMS-2 state vector is loaded into the SPoC.

In OPS 2, components of the current state vector are provided by the GPCs
using the GNC SPEC 34 Orbit Targeting display.  Remember, values displayed
on the CRT are continuously updated.  Press SPEC to freeze the display.
The time tag, along with position and velocity components, can now be
entered into the SPoC STATE VECTOR UPDATE form.

In OPS 3, components of the current state vector are provided by the GPCs
using the GNC SPEC 0 GPC Memory display.  SPEC 0 item entries are listed
in the Reference Data Book Flight Supplement.  After the six state vector
components have been requested and displayed, press SPEC to freeze the
display.  The time tag, along with position and velocity components, can
now be entered into the SPoC STATE VECTOR UPDATE form.  Note: The GPC time
tag displayed with the state vector may have up to a 1.8 second delta from
the state vector's true time tag.  This is due to differing update rates
for these quantities on the GPC Memory display.

When settings in the form reflect the frozen SPEC 34 (SPEC 0 in OPS 3),

SECTION 10.0  WORLD MAP


SITE MANAGER Main Menu

The first time WORLD MAP is selected from the SPoC Main Menu, the SITE
MANAGER Main Menu will be displayed.  SITE MANAGER is a WORLD MAP function
which will be detailed in Section 10.4.  For now, execute the first menu
item "INVOKE DEFAULT COMMUNICATION SITES" and proceed to the WORLD MAP
display.


WORLD MAP serves as a crew aid which provides a situation display, various
timers, and tables.  The situation display includes a map with a longitude
range from 180 degrees West to 180 degrees East, and a typical latitude
range from 65 degrees North to 65 degrees South.  A map with any valid
latitude range can be provided by the SPoC Team upon request.


10.1 World Map Help Menu

The WORLD MAP Help Menu may be invoked by pressing "CODE-?" with the WORLD
MAP display active.  This menu provides the "CODE-[key]" combinations
associated with each WORLD MAP function.  WORLD MAP functions may be
invoked from the Help Menu, or may be invoked from the WORLD MAP display
directly with the proper "CODE-[key]" input.  To return to the WORLD MAP
Display, press "CODE-ESC".


10.2 World Map Display

The contents of the WORLD MAP Display are described in detail below.

       +==========================================================+

10.2.1 Current MET (Item 1)

DD/HH:MM:SS fields will update approximately every second and are
displayed continuously.  These are calculated based on the current GMT and
the GMT of launch.

10.2.2 AOS/LOS of TDRS Coverage (Item 2)

The ID and countdown time to AOS or LOS of TDRS coverage is displayed in
this window.  If multiple satellites have overlapping coverage, the AOS
countdown time to the first TDRS will be displayed.  After AOS of the
first TDRS, the ID and LOS of the last TDRS with overlapping coverage is
displayed.  "STAND BY" will be displayed in this window until AOS/LOS
times have been calculated.

10.2.3 AOS/LOS of Ground Communication Site (Item 3)

This window displays the ID, radio frequency band(s), and countdown time
to AOS or LOS of a ground communication site.  AOS and LOS are defined as
an elevation of the Orbiter, viewed from the ground site, of 0.0 degrees.
Neither terrain masking nor atmospheric refraction are considered in this
calculation.  If sites have overlapping coverage, the AOS countdown time
of the first site will be displayed.  After AOS of the first site, the ID
and LOS of the last site in this overlapping coverage is displayed.  Then
the radio frequency band(s) displayed will be that of the currently
acquisitioned site(s).  "STAND BY" will be displayed in this window until
AOS/LOS times have been calculated.

10.2.4 Spacecraft Sunrise, Noon, Sunset (Item 4)

The countdown time to spacecraft sunrise ("SR"), noon ("SN"), or sunset
("SS") is displayed in this window.  If the time to spacecraft
sunrise/sunset or noon is greater than 100 minutes, the timer will
countdown from 99:59 to 99:00 then cycle until 99:59 is the correct time.
Shuttle sunrise and sunset are defined with respect to the upper limb of
the sun with a fixed bias to offset the effects of refraction.  Press
"CODE-S" to toggle between spacecraft sunrise/sunset and noon.  Spacecraft
sunrise, noon, and sunset functions share this window on a mutually
exclusive basis.

10.2.5 TDRS Coverage (Item 5)

Limits of TDRS coverage are displayed assuming average nominal orbital
altitude for a flight.

10.2.6 Earth Day/Night (Item 6)

The sunlight terminator separates day/night regions on earth's surface and
is updated in real time.  The region in daylight is displayed with inverse
video.

10.2.7 Earth Observation Area (Item 7)

The flashing rectangle highlights an earth observation site.  The area
approximates extent of the site to be observed.  A site is acquired when
any part viewed from the Orbiter is within 40 degrees of the current
nadir.  The next available site will initially be displayed.  Press
"CODE-F" to move forward one available site at a time until the last
predicted ground track point is encountered.  To return to the next
available site, press "CODE-R".  The displayed site is shown until
acquired, then the next site is highlighted with a flashing rectangle.

10.2.8 Ground Communication Sites (Item 8)

Limits of selected ground communication sites, with terrain masking, are
displayed assuming average nominal orbital altitude for a flight.

10.2.9 Shuttle Bug (Item 9)

The nose of the flashing Shuttle Bug indicates current position of the
Orbiter.  Every thirty seconds, the Shuttle Bug's position is updated to
the next predicted ground track point.

10.2.10 Enlarged F-Stop Display (Item 10)

For ease of viewing, the current camera F-Stop is enlarged and displayed.
This is the same camera F-Stop value described in Item 13.  The enlarged
F-Stop display may be toggled ON or OFF by pressing "CODE-CTRL-SHIFT-F".
For high inclination orbits, position of the enlarged F-Stop display will
vary slightly.  This is done to avoid display conflicts with predicted
ground tracks and the Shuttle Bug.

10.2.11 Current and Two Predicted Ground Tracks (Item 11)

Predicted ground tracks are updated when the Shuttle Bug reaches the
predicted ground track point 5400 seconds (90 minutes) from the first.
The Shuttle Bug then occupies the first ground track point in a series
extending 4.5 hours into the future.  Adjacent ground track points are
separated in time by 30 seconds.

10.2.12 Tone Indicator (Item 12)

"ON" indicates a tone will be generated when the currently displayed earth
observation site countdown timer reaches two minutes.  "OFF" indicates no
tone will be generated.  The default setting is "ON".  The tone indicator
may be toggled "ON" and "OFF" by pressing "CODE-T".

10.2.13 Latitude, Longitude, and Current F-Stop (Item 13)

The Orbiter's current latitude, longitude, and the camera F-Stop required
for an average albedo target at the current spacecraft nadir are updated
once every 30 seconds.  "CODE-L" immediately updates this display and
toggles it from dynamic to frozen. While frozen, the display will flash
approximately once/second.  This display window is shared, on a mutually
exclusive basis, with items 16, 17, and 18.

10.2.14 Ascending Node Time (Item 14)

This window displays elapsed time since previous ascending node or
countdown to the next ascending node.  The display is controlled in
conjunction with items 16 and 17.

10.2.15 Earth Observation Site (Item 15)

The site ID is displayed along with the countdown time to acquisition of
the displayed earth observation site.  The program searches for
acquisition only.  Once acquisition is achieved, the program will search
for acquisition of the next available site.  If no earth observation site
has been found within the predicted ground tracks, "*****  XX:XX" will be
displayed.  The F-Stop for this site is also displayed.  This F-Stop is
based on a predetermined albedo for the current site, a set film and
shutter speed, and the computed sun angle.  Since F-Stop values are
computed in discrete 1/2 F-Stop steps, a difference of 1/2 F-Stop between
the SPoC value and a premission value is not unusual.

SPoC observation site F-Stops are computed for acquisition, but the
premission albedos consider an average across the entire site.  For sites
with significant physical size, this can result in F-Stop differences of
as much as 1 and 1/2 to 2 full F-Stops in extreme cases.

10.2.16 Longitude, MET, and Countdown Timer For Next Ascending Node (Item
16)

A keyboard input of "CODE-N" will display the longitude and MET of the
next ascending node in the bottom center window, replacing any data
previously displayed there.  Also the countdown time for this node will be
displayed in the Ascending Node Time window (Item 14).  This function
shares the bottom middle window, on a mutually exclusive basis, with Items
13, 17, and 18.

10.2.17 Longitude, MET, and Time Since Previous Ascending Node (Item 17)

A keyboard input of "CODE-CTRL-SHIFT-N" will display the longitude and MET
of the previous ascending node in the bottom center window, replacing any
data previously displayed there.  Elapsed time since the previous
ascending node will also be displayed in the Ascending Node Time window
(Item 14).  This function shares the bottom middle window, on a mutually
exclusive basis, with Items 13, 16, and 18.

10.2.18 Sun Glint Angle and Azimuth (Item 18)

A keyboard input of "CODE-G" will display the sun glintpoint
angle-of-reflection and azimuth relative to the Orbiter.  These data are
displayed in the bottom center window, replacing any data previously
displayed there. "GLINT ANGL" is the angle-of-reflection of the sun's
image off the Earth's surface.  "AZ" is the angle measured from the
vehicle true heading in the Orbiter local horizontal plane to the
glintpoint azimuth and accumulated in the direction "east of north".  In
other words, the difference "true azimuth of the sun glintpoint minus
current Orbiter true heading" is "AZ".  Sun glint data are displayed only
if the "GLINT ANGL" is between 9.99 degrees and 80.21 degrees.  Otherwise,
Xs are displayed in place of the data.  This function shares the bottom
middle window, on a mutually exclusive basis, with Items 13, 16, and 17.

10.2.19 Sun Glintpoint Area (Item 18a)

A "CODE-G" keyboard input will also graphically display the sun glintpoint
relative to the Shuttle by flashing a small square on the WORLD MAP.


10.3 PSAT

A Predicted Site Acquisition Table (PSAT) is available for the current and
two predicted ground tracks.  Press "CODE-P" to call up the PSAT Display.
There are two windows for this display.  The upper window displays TDRS
data, while the lower window displays ground site data.  Each window has a
light bar which serves as an aid for reading data across a row.  Press
"UPARROW" and "DOWNARROW" to control light bar movement in the lower
window.  Press "SHIFT-UPARROW" and "SHIFT-DOWNARROW" to control light bar
movement in the upper window.

If there are more lines of data than can be displayed in a PSAT window at
one time, only sites with LOS in the future will be visible when the
display appears.  Users may scroll up or down to view data not currently
in the window.  Small up/down arrows indicate if more data are available.
Users may scroll in the direction of the arrows to view the additional
data.  When the bottom or top of the table is reached, the appropriate
arrow will vanish.

"More Data Arrows": Indicate that more data are available above or below
those currently visible.

"LOS Indicators": Indicate the site has an LOS in the past.

"Light Bar": Visual aid in reading across a row.  May be moved with the
arrow keys as described above.

"XX/XX:XX:XX    XX:XX": Indicates the data are not currently available.

To return to the WORLD MAP Display, press "CODE-ESC"


10.4 SITE MANAGER

SITE MANAGER allows users to:

* 1) Turn communication sites ON or OFF.
* 2) Add/edit communications site data.
* 3) Delete user input communications sites.
* 4) Add/edit earth observation site data.
* 5) Delete user input earth observation sites.


On the first call to WORLD MAP from the SPoC Main Menu, the SITE MANAGER
Main Menu will be displayed.  During subsequent calls to WORLD MAP,
control will pass directly to the WORLD MAP Display.  SITE MANAGER may
also be invoked from the WORLD MAP Help Menu or by pressing "CODE-E" from
the WORLD MAP Display.

The SITE MANAGER Main Menu is displayed on the first call to WORLD MAP as
a reminder that the previous user may have reconfigured communication or
earth observation sites.  This allows users easy access to verify
configuration of the sites.

If a communication site is ON, the site will be included in AOS/LOS
searches.  If it is OFF, the site will not be included in AOS/LOS
searches.  The AOS/LOS search drives the WORLD MAP AOS/LOS countdown
windows and PSAT Display.  SPoC premission site data cannot be altered or
deleted by users.  Only user input site data may be altered or deleted by
users.

10.4.1 SITE MANAGER Exit Options

Three options on the SITE MANAGER Main Menu will exit SITE MANAGER and
proceed to the WORLD MAP program.

10.4.1.1 CODE-D     INVOKE DEFAULT COMMUNICATION SITES

APPENDIX E--SPoC HISTORY



The concept of an independent computational capability aboard the Shuttle
has been operational since STS-1.  Originally, an HP41 calculator was
employed for this purpose.  Data storage and manipulation capabilities,
absent from the GPC's because of core storage limitations, were provided
by this hand-held calculator.  Also provided by the HP41 were capabilities
similar to existing ground-based processors in the event that the Shuttle
and crew were in a no-communication situation.  As of April 5, 1983 the
HP41 flight programs included the following:


a) The CG program allowed the crew to track current X and Y-CG location as
a function of MET, OMS, and RCS propellant loadings, and whether payloads
were berthed or deployed.


b) The AOS program supplied the crew with information concerning the next
time the spacecraft would acquire a communications site.


c) The LANDTRACK program provided observation pass information for any
stored earth observation site.


d) The DEORBIT program provided the crew with deorbit maneuver targets in
the event of total loss of communications with the ground and a
time-critical systems failure requiring an emergency deorbit.


e) The ORBIT program provided the crew with data concerning attitudes and
rates involved in the star sighting function and with orbit sunrise and
sunset.


f) The ALARM program gave the crew a personalized reminder of upcoming
events of particular interest by having the calculator sound a tone and
display a pre-stored message.


g) The LANDING program computed data necessary for the approach and
landing phase of flight.


Although the HP41 has proven to be a useful tool, it has a very limited
memory capacity (only one of the above programs can be stored in memory at
a time), very limited text displays, and there is no graphics capability.

As new requirements developed for independent computational capabilities
aboard the Shuttle, the HP41 became inadequate for the task.  To augment
the hand-held calculator, the SPoC was introduced.  SPoC is an expansion
of the HP41 calculator concept and enhances independent computation and
display capabilities by providing more memory, more mass storage, and
graphic displays. In 1983, the Ascent/Entry Procedures Section of the
Operations Branch began evaluating microcomputers for onboard
implementation.  After evaluating several machines, a GRiD microcomputer
was selected because it met the hardware and software requirements and
constraints fully.  A proposal was made to the Government Furnished
Equipment (GFE) Configuration Control Board (CCB) to obtain the necessary
funding for the project.  The GFE CCB denied the request.  To gain
necessary support for the project, presentations were made at the branch,
division, and directorate levels.  After a SPoC presentation was made to
the Program Office Manager, Glynn Lunny, approval for the SPoC project was
given. Proposals were again made to the GFE CCB, and on 08/15/83 a Crew
Related GFE CCB Directive (#3D149) was issued authorizing purchase,
testing, certification, and preparation for flight of a GRiD Compass
Computer on STS-9.

Purchased commercially and modified, the original SPoC was a GRiD Compass
1101 lap top computer.  The Compass 1101 has a 4.75 by 3.5 inch
electroluminescent screen, 384K bytes of non-volatile bubble memory and
256K bytes of RAM. Modifications included replacing the internal modem
with a fan for cooling, since the standard Model 1101 computer uses
convective cooling.  The lithium battery circuit, which provides power for
the internal clock while the Compass is not connected to an external power
supply, had supplemental diodes and a fuse installed to insure failsafe
operation. A power cable was designed for Orbiter power connector
compatibility.  EMI tests showed the SPoC was out of specification.  Since
the out-of-spec condition for SPoC would cause no problems for Orbiter
systems, communications, or payloads, the Space Shuttle Program
Requirements Control Board issued a directive (#S23562) to authorize a
waiver permitting the radiated EMI out-of-spec condition.

SPoC was initially flown on STS-9 as a proof of concept engineering
evaluation.  During this flight, it proved useful as an aid to crew
awareness and productivity.  SPoC flight software for STS-9 included
programs that calculated and/or displayed the following data:

          MET
          The world map (facsimile of the MCC world map)
          Day and night areas on the earth's surface
          AOS/LOS ID of the current/next ground communication site
          AOS/LOS and ID of current/next TDRSS coverage
          Current and two predicted ground tracks
          Current position of the Orbiter on the world map
          AOS of the next earth observation site

Brewster Shaw, pilot for STS-9, stated "It's really a big asset to know
where we are all the time."  Since SPoC was such an asset on STS-9, Flight
Equipment Project Office Configuration Control Board Directive #G1309
authorized one SPoC and power cord be manifested for STS-11 and subsequent
missions.

An upgrade occurred in late 1984, with the Compass 1129 replacing the 1101
for STS-51C and subsequent missions.  The GRiD Compass 1129 is the same
size as the 1101, with a 4.75 by 3.5 inch electroluminescent screen and
384K bytes of non-volatile bubble memory.  Improvements gained with the
1129 include twice as much RAM (512K bytes) and four accessible slots for
PROM or EPROM chips.  At this time, the necessary hardware and software
were purchased to develop EPROMs for flight.  Use of socketed PROM and
EPROM chips was viewed as a possible interim solution for expanded mass
memory until a mass memory device was certified for flight.  Compass 1129s
were purchased commercially and modified.  The internal modem was replaced
with a fan for cooling and an EMI reducing "Tempest" screen was installed.
For crew safety, the lithium battery which provided power for the internal
clock was exchanged for a replaceable silver oxide battery and a clock
reset circuit.  Also the foot was milled out to promote internal
ventilation while in the closed position for flight operation.

In 1985, the SPoC was upgraded to a GRiD Compass 1139 for STS-51G and
subsequent missions.  The GRiD Compass 1139 is similar to the 1129, having
the same memory capacity.  It is an improvement over the 1129 because it
has a larger electroluminescent screen (7.5 by 3.5 inches) and a standard
internal fan for cooling. Like the 1129, this unit was purchased
commercially and modified for flight.  Modifications include an
EMI-reducing "Tempest" screen, a replaceable silver oxide battery, a clock
reset circuit, a milled out foot, and the modem is removed.

The original flight software configuration has been augmented since STS-9
to satisfy expanding functional requirements levied on the SPoC.  The
flight software configuration now includes programs that calculate and/or
display the following data:

          Predicted Site Acquisition Table
          Table of TDRSS AOS/LOS
          Communication/Earth Obs site reconfiguration
          Latitude and longitude of the Orbiter
          AOS of future earth observation sites
          Time to Orbiter sunrise, noon, sunset
          Current F stop
          F stop for the selected earth observation site
          Sun glint position on the world map
          Sun glint look angles
          Longitude and MET of the next/previous ascending node
          Time until/from the next/previous ascending node
          Deorbit opportunities
          Deorbit maneuver targeting
          Orbiter CG and weight
          CG management procedures

The SPoC has also been used to provide computational support for special
purpose applications on a flight-specific basis.  The Orbital Refueling
System (ORS) and the Gravity Gradient Free Drift experiments set a
precedent for using microprocessors  to support payload experiments.

Since 41-G, two SPoCs have been manifested for each Shuttle mission.  The
primary unit is usually positioned on the forward flight deck above the
eyebrow panel, while the backup nominally supports middeck operations.
Even during emergency power-downs, one of these units remains running.


"NONCRITICAL BUT MANDATORY"

Although the SPoC was classified as noncritical hardware by Configuration
Control Board Directive 1253, it is considered mandatory equipment.  If
the SPoC fails, neither the crew nor the mission is threatened: thus the
noncritical classification.  However, the SPoC is such an asset to the
crew and to MCC that it is mandatory equipment for flight.

The following excerpts from reports and memos illustrate the importance of
the SPoC to Shuttle missions.

"STS-9 Flight Crew Report" (Dec. 1983): "The SPoC proved to be a great
asset.  It was unstowed and set up during the post insertion timeframe and
remained active until deorbit prep... The SPoC allowed the crew to see
where they were at all times and served as an accurate source of
communications coverage information.  In light of the many dropouts of
TDRSS S-Band signal that were experienced, the SPoC AOS/LOS information
allowed the crew to manage the comm system in an efficient manner and
eliminated unnecessary trouble shooting.  The SPoC appears to have great
potential that deserves further development for future Shuttle missions."

"Memo from the Space Shuttle Earth Observations Project Manager"
(03/02/84, #SC5-84-32):  "The GRiD SPoC has been of great value to the
Space Shuttle Earth Observations Project... Our contact with the crews
that have used the SPoC ...reflect extreme interest in its present
capabilities and proposed updates."

The value of the SPoC in monitoring a payload was demonstrated for the
STS-41G ORS test:

"Memo from John Young" (04/18/84, #CB-84-042):  "The SPoC has been
determined by the crew to be not just useful, but mandatory for proper
crew monitoring of ORS hydrazine transfer operations.  It provides the
proper displays that provide the crew their only insight into the
hydrazine heat transfer occurring during an ORS transfer operation for all
initial conditions.  Using the SPoC information and the other ORS displays
and controls, timely and proper response can be made by the crew to any
ORS anomaly."

"STS-41G Debrief Notes" (10/18/84): "[The SPoC was] very helpful because
no one had time to just sit by a window and watch for sites and
phenomena."

"STS-51C Crew Report": "The presence of SPoC on our mission was a major
asset in helping us perform many of our tasks.  Future capabilities for
SPoC will increase its utility even more...these computers have proven to
be very reliable..."

"Memo from On-Orbit Flight Techniques Panel" (01/25/88, #DA8- 88-04):
"After reviewing the functions provided by the SPoC and assessing the
significant degree of support it provides for routine flight crew
operations, the FTP considers it to be a very important part of crew
equipment and recommends the Program consider it to be 'mandatory' for all
STS flights.

"The FTP also recommends that the SPoC should continue to be classified as
criticality 3.  These recommendations are based on two considerations.



a) The primary SPoC function, that of an orbit trajectory status display,
does not jeopardize the crew, vehicle, or mission in the event of
malfunction.


b) The secondary SPoC function of providing a backup deorbit targeting
capability for emergency deorbit would only be used when the Mission
Control Center is unavailable for Orbiter support and an immediate deorbit
was required.  The probability of this happening is extremely remote
because for every case except a large cabin leak, it takes multiple
failures before this capability would be needed, and most of those
combinations of failures, such as failure of both freon loops, are
considered non-credible.


"Retaining the SPoC's criticality 3 classification is highly desirable
because it allows a flexible and rapid response to new requirements.  To
retain these desirable characteristics, functions considered inappropriate
for this classification should be integrated into other processors of an
appropriate classification."
