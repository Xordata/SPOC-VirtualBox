Shuttle Portable Computer Software

This is an edited version of the Shuttle ground track program used by
the astronauts in flights aboard the Shuttle.  More complete documentation
is provided in the self-extracting ZIP file.  If you don't have the hardware
setup described below, it is likely that this program will not run for you.

In keeping with the NASA Spacelink file naming convention, SPOCZIP.EXE is named
9_11_4_17_3.BIN on the system.  Be sure to rename it SPOCZIP.EXE when you
download it.  Begin by placing it in your C> root directory.

To "unzip" the file, enter the following in your hard drive ROOT
directory at the C> prompt and then press return:

C> SPOCZIP -d

Adding -d will cause the ZIP program to create a subdirectory named PROGRAMS
and fill it with files.

Orbital state vectors required for this program are available from NASA
Spacelink for each non-classified Shuttle mission. Use the "M50 Elements"
figures.  And remember that SPoC requires figures in thousands of feet.  The
M50 elements on NASA Spacelink are normally given in feet.  Don't forget to
move the decimal three places to the left before entering the figures into
SPoC.

The following hardware is required for proper operation of this program:

     IBM PC or compatible WITH MATH CO-PROCESSOR INSTALLED!
     Hard Drive at location C>
     Minimum 512K available memory  NOTE:  If you are running software
       (network software for example) that occupies enough memory to
       leave less than 512K for SPoC, SPoC will very likely crash.

GRID.EXE, SPOC.BAT, and the PROGRAMS subdirectory, must be located in the
Drive C> ROOT directory.

To run the SPoC program type SPOC at the C> prompt and press return.

NOTE: The CODE key referred to in the documentation for this document is the
      ALT key on IBM PC compatible computers.

NOTE: SPoC was originally written for a GRID computer--not an IBM-PC.  Before
      making SPoC available through NASA Spacelink, we tested it on a variety
      of IBM-PC and compatible computer configurations with mixed results.  For
      example, SPoC seemed to be running OK on one computer, but its VGA
      display scrambled the screen making the program unreadable.  We suspect
      that SPoC	is incompatible with VGA.  So if SPoC doesn't run on your
      particular setup, try it on another computer.  We recommend CGA, but we
      have seen the program run properly on EGA setups.

AND A LAST NOTE:  Several people have reported receiving the error message
      "Can't find file EMULATOR.SHR"   This is the error message you'll receive
      when you try to run the program without a math co-processor.
